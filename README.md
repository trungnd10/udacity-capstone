# Functionality of the application

This application will allow creating/removing/updating/fetching Image. Each user only has access to items that he/she has created.

## Prerequisites

* <a href="https://manage.auth0.com/" target="_blank">Auth0 account</a>
* <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub account</a>
* <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/" target="_blank">NodeJS</a> version up to 12.xx 
* Serverless 
   * Create a <a href="https://dashboard.serverless.com/" target="_blank">Serverless account</a> user
   * Install the Serverless Frameworkâ€™s CLI  (up to VERSION=2.21.1). Refer to the <a href="https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/" target="_blank">official documentation</a> for more help.
   ```bash
   npm install -g serverless@2.21.1
   serverless --version
   ```
   * Login and configure serverless to use the AWS credentials 
   ```bash
   # Login to your dashboard from the CLI. It will ask to open your browser and finish the process.
   serverless login
   # Configure serverless to use the AWS credentials to deploy the application
   # You need to have a pair of Access key (YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID and YOUR_SECRET_KEY) of an IAM user with Admin access permissions
   sls config credentials --provider aws --key YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID --secret YOUR_SECRET_KEY --profile serverless
   ```

# Frontend

The `client` folder contains a web application that can use the API that should be developed in the project.

This frontend should work with your serverless application once it is developed, you don't need to make any changes to the code. The only file that you need to edit is the `config.ts` file in the `client` folder. This file configures your client application just as it was done in the course and contains an API endpoint and Auth0 configuration:

```ts
const apiId = '...' API Gateway id
export const apiEndpoint = `https://${apiId}.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev`

export const authConfig = {
  domain: '...',    // Domain from Auth0
  clientId: '...',  // Client id from an Auth0 application
  callbackUrl: 'http://localhost:3000/callback'
}
```

## Authentication

To implement authentication in your application, you would have to create an Auth0 application and copy "domain" and "client id" to the `config.ts` file in the `client` folder. We recommend using asymmetrically encrypted JWT tokens.

# How to run the application

## Backend

To deploy an application run the following commands:

```
cd backend
npm install
sls deploy -v
```

## Frontend

To run a client application first edit the `client/src/config.ts` file to set correct parameters. And then run the following commands:

```
cd client
npm install
npm run start
```

This should start a development server with the React application that will interact with the serverless application.

# Postman collection

An alternative way to test your API, you can use the Postman collection that contains sample requests. You can find a Postman collection in this project.
